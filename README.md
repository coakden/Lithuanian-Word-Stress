# Lithuanian Word Stress

This project is based on a production experiment I conducted as part of my first Qualifying Paper. The main question broached by the study is: How is word stress realized in a language which also exhibits lexical tone/pitch accent contrasts? To answer this question, I conducted an acoustic experiment on Lithuanian, a language with both word stress and lexical pitch accent, and a putative case of tone-driven stress.

My goal with this repo is to share the qualitative methods I employed in the study, that is, how I cleaned/organized the raw data, conducted basic exploratory analysis, and constructed statistical models to test the experiment hypotheses. 

Included in this repo are folders containing separate R scripts for data organization, exploratory data analysis, and linear mixed effects models; folders for raw and clean data; folders for figures generated from the data; an html slide presentation on an incomplete version of the project; and a manuscript.
